Placement Eligibility Streamlit Application

Overview:
This project is an interactive Streamlit application that allows placement teams to filter and identify eligible students based on customizable criteria. It leverages synthetic data generation (Faker), relational databases, SQL queries, and OOP principles in Python to provide actionable insights for student placement readiness.

Key Features:

Handles both numerical and categorical student performance metrics including programming scores, soft skills, internships, and mock interviews.

Implements a Python OOP-based structure for modular and reusable code.

Generates realistic student data using the Faker library for testing and simulation.

Writes SQL queries to extract insights such as top performers, average scores per batch, and placement readiness distribution.

Deployed as a Streamlit web application for interactive filtering and visualization of eligible candidates.

Tech Stack:

Python: pandas, numpy, streamlit, faker, sqlite3

Database: SQLite / MySQL

Deployment: Streamlit

Version Control: GitHub

Project Highlights:

Designed four interrelated tables: Students, Programming, Soft Skills, Placements.

Developed dynamic filtering capabilities in Streamlit for eligibility criteria like minimum problems solved or soft skills score.

Integrated SQL-based analytics to generate actionable insights for placement management.

Built a user-friendly interface for real-time candidate evaluation.
